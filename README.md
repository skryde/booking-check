## About

Am I over engineering this thing? Yes, probably

Why? Cuz I can ðŸ˜Œ (and it's a beautiful opportunity to learn new technologies)

Which technologies? NATS, for example.

## Getting started

1. Clone or download this repository

2. `cp .env.example .env`

3. Edit `.env` file and set your Telegram Bot token and your own Telegram ID. Your Telegram ID is used to enable you, as
   the bot owner/admin, some extra commands that are not available for everyone.

   If you don't know your Telegram ID, you can run the bot without this variable and get your ID by executing the Bot
   command `/me`.

4. Execute the containers: `docker compose up -d`
